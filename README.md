# Advent of Code 2021

My repository to track [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Goals

1. Complete every challenge
2. Use each of the following languages for at least one challenge: Python, TypeScript, Golang, Rust, C, Haskell, Ruby (more to be added?)
3. Engage in discussion about the challenges with my friends

## Recap

### Goals

1. I did complete every challenge - I ended up getting a bit of help for some of the problems
2. I ended up only using Python this year. I ended up having at on of fun using it.
3. I was able to discuss a few problems with my friends! It was nice having them to work with.

### Notes

I had a ton of fun doing this - I'm glad I ended up sticking with this. I found a pattern I liked to use for the solutions. I think next year I'm going to try to have a more consistent approach. I'm not sure if I'll use Python or not. It's my favorite language, and super convenient for solving challenges like this. I would like to go for some top 100 finishes next year!
